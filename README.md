Sql Startup Success and Failure Analysis using SQL

Project Steps:

Data Collection: Gathering datasets from sources AngelList: startup databases containing information on startups, funding rounds, market trends, and company profiles.

Data Preparation:

Load the datasets into a SQL database. My sql
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency using Excel.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

I performed initial exploratory analysis using SQL queries to understand the structure and content of the datasets.

Feature Engineering: • Create new features that may be indicative of startup success or failure, such as funding amount per round, time between funding rounds, or industry-specific metrics. I used an indicator of the increase in funds compared to the year, a counter for signal startup by quarter, and a signal by location.

Factors Analysis:

I used SQL queries to analyze factors contributing to startup success, such as funding raised, market size, leadership team experience, and geographic location.
Identify common reasons for startup failures, such as funding issues, market fit problems, or operational challenges. (Indicators indicate a decline compared to previous years and also a decrease in the amount available to them. With different regions, it is difficult for them to balance the transfer cases.).

Comparative Analysis:

Analyze trends over time or across different industries to identify patterns in startup outcomes. (I compared the years to each other to predict the coming period, and it is likely that they will not advance.)

Visualization and reporting:

Create SQL queries to generate visualizations (optional) or export summary reports that highlight key findings and insights.
I used Datax API: https://app.databox.com/datawall/4c2b4250f93275d044eeb0488d2c4dd931fce6466a52ae0.
